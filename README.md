# gh-action-stats

Analytics platform for Github actions

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see the app running. By default it is connected to the production back end so you are able to access your data on your local host.

## Start Collecting Analytics

To start collecting analytics, visit the [get started page](https://actions.boringday.co/get-started) and visit the [`gh-action-stats` npm pacakge](https://github.com/michmich112/gh-action-stats-js).

## Badges

Badges are accessible from the action's dashboard by clicking on the gear icon on the upper lefthand side of the page. 
> Note: There could be a problem with the first time you try to access the badges for it to create the initial badges
